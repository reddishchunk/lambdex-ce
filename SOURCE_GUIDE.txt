	- contains: 
		- symbol table:

controller.h:
	- contains: the control structure that is responsible for holding:
		- pointer to the symbol table
		- pointer to the entry AST node
		- pointer to the entire token list
		- operations: allocate, free, link/unlink symbol table, link/unlink entry AST node

ast.h:
	- contains:
		- ast nodes, ast node operations
		- ast node tree operations

token_list.h:
	- contains:
		

parse.h:
	parsing operations

lex.h:
